Good job, you've read me.

At the moment due to one lazy line IRC support is linux/mac only

The compiled server launcher must be in the same directory as the minecraft server. 

java -classpath pircbot.jar:. ServerLauncher_j2

or on windows:

java -classpath pircbot.jar;. ServerLauncher_j2


It will auto-create the files it needs on first start.
